Task: 
    How might mycelium evolve the ability to survive in the void of space?
    

            Your role is to focus on Premise Formation & Initial Hypothesis within this context.
            Consider these aspects:
            1. Core mechanisms and processes
            2. Potential adaptations and pathways
            3. Required structural changes
            4. Environmental challenges and solutions
            5. Biological feasibility

            Analyze this step by step:
            1. Break down the core requirements
            2. Identify key mechanisms
            3. Map potential pathways
            4. Assess challenges
            5. Evaluate feasibility
            6. Synthesize findings

            IMPORTANT: Format your response EXACTLY as a JSON object with this structure:
            {
                "processed_output": {
