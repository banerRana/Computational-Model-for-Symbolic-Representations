Glyphs act as conceptual tags that represent abstract ideas or domains, allowing users to steer the AI's focus within specific conceptual areas. These symbols leverage existing neural network mechanisms like contextual priming and attention to channel the AI's probabilistic processes into defined areas of focus. This approach doesn't invent new AI capabilities but repurposes existing features to draw out richer, more intentional responses.",
